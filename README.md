# flask-mnist-cnn
I trained a digit classifier using CNN. I was also learning about flask then.

I thought why not extend my limits and see if I can do something creative.

So I created an webapp that allows you draw a digit using javascript and get predictions on that.

Here is a demo on how it works.
